# peruse — Design for a Lightweight Local Directory Viewer

**Status:** Implemented (v1) — this document remains the source of truth for
architecture decisions.

A small web server you run in any local directory that gives you a two-column
browsing UI: directory tree on the left, rendered file on the right, with
first-class markdown rendering, syntax-highlighted code, git status awareness,
inline per-hunk diffs, and live updates as files change on disk. Catppuccin
themed (Latte light / Mocha dark).

```
bunx @talkasab/peruse   # serve the current directory at http://127.0.0.1:7440
```

(The bare npm name `peruse` is squatted by an abandoned 2017 package, so the
package publishes under a scope; the installed command is still `peruse`.
Until it's published, `bunx github:talkasab/peruse` works straight from the
repo, and `bun build --compile` produces standalone per-platform binaries for
GitHub releases — no Bun required by the end user.)

---

## 1. Requirements

1. Two-column layout: directory tree (left), viewed file (right)
2. GOOD markdown rendering (GitHub-flavored)
3. GOOD code rendering (real syntax highlighting, not an afterthought)
4. Git status shown in the tree; filter to changed/new files
5. For changed files, a *subtle* indication of *where* changes are; clicking an
   individual change opens **that hunk's diff in a popup anchored at the
   mark** — never a whole-page diff view
6. Watches the directory tree and keeps open views up to date

Constraints: as little code as possible — assemble best-in-class existing
solutions rather than building anything from scratch. Catppuccin light + dark.

## 2. Research: what already exists

No single existing tool covers all six requirements; each covers a slice:

| Tool | Tree | Markdown | Code | Git status | Inline diffs | Watch | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [markserv](https://github.com/markserv/markserv) / [mdserver](https://github.com/deepdadou/mdserver) / [gh-markdown-preview](https://github.com/yusukebe/gh-markdown-preview) | dir index only | ✅ | partial | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | Markdown + live reload, no git at all |
| [difit](https://github.com/yoshiko-pg/difit) | changed files only | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (GitHub-style) | partial | Excellent diff review UI, but not a directory *browser* — no markdown, no unchanged files |
| [diffhub](https://github.com/mblode/diffhub) | changed files only | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Same category as difit |
| `code serve-web` / code-server | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Covers everything but is a full IDE: heavyweight, editing-oriented, not a calm reading view |
| [Ferrite](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | Native desktop app (Rust/egui), not a web server |
| klaus / gitweb / Gitea | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | commit-oriented | commit-oriented | ❌ | Browse *commits*, not the live working tree |

**Conclusion:** the gap is real but narrow — every individual capability is a
solved problem with a clear best-in-class library. The right build is a thin
glue server plus one page that composes those libraries, not a new app.

## 3. Recommended architecture

**A small Bun package: a ~5-route server plus one static page.** All
rendering happens in the browser; the server only serves files, answers git
questions, and pushes change events. Total new code target: **under ~900
lines**, distributed as an npm package (`bunx @talkasab/peruse`) and as
standalone compiled binaries.

### Why Bun

An earlier draft proposed a Python/Starlette single-file server (anchored on
the host repo's uv tooling — see §7), then Node. Bun is the better fit for
the "as little code as possible" constraint:

- **Every rendering dependency is npm-native.** markdown-it, Shiki, diff2html,
  Alpine — the best-in-class stack *is* the JS ecosystem, and Bun consumes it
  directly as normal pinned dependencies, bundled at publish time.
- **Bun's built-ins replace three dependencies.** `Bun.serve` (HTTP + routing
  + streaming SSE via `ReadableStream`) replaces Hono; the built-in
  `bun build` bundler replaces esbuild; `Bun.spawn` covers the git
  subprocess. The server ends up with **one** external runtime dependency
  (the file watcher).
- **Distribution:** `bunx @talkasab/peruse` for Bun users, and
  `bun build --compile` cross-compiles standalone single-file executables
  (macOS arm64/x64, Linux, Windows) for GitHub releases — end users need
  nothing installed at all, not even Bun.
- **One language** across server and client.

### Component choices (all best-in-class, all boring)

| Concern | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP server | **`Bun.serve`** (built-in) | Five routes need no framework: Bun.serve's `routes` map + `Bun.file` static serving + a `ReadableStream` for SSE keep the server one small zero-framework file |
| File watching | **[chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar)** | The de-facto standard watcher (powers Vite et al.), runs fine on Bun. Bun's native `fs.watch` has [known event-reliability gaps](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/discussions/1571), so the battle-tested library earns its place as the server's only dependency; revisit if Bun's watcher matures |
| Git interrogation | **`git` subprocess** (`status --porcelain=v2`, `diff`) | Zero dependencies, always agrees with the user's git; porcelain v2 is a stable machine format. simple-git/nodegit add weight for no benefit |
| Markdown | **[markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it)** + task-list/anchor plugins | The de-facto CommonMark+GFM renderer (VS Code uses it). Critically, its token `map` gives **source line ranges per block** — which is what makes requirement 5 work on *rendered* markdown |
| Code highlighting | **[Shiki](https://shiki.style)** | TextMate-grammar highlighting (identical quality to VS Code). Ships **Catppuccin Latte/Frappé/Macchiato/Mocha as bundled themes**, and its [dual-theme mode](https://shiki.style/guide/dual-themes) emits CSS-variable output so light/dark switching is pure CSS |
| Hunk diff rendering | **[diff2html](https://github.com/rtfpessoa/diff2html)** (per-hunk) | The standard "GitHub-style diff from raw `git diff` text" library; we feed it one hunk at a time (§5); colors overridable via CSS variables → Catppuccin-able |
| UI reactivity | **Alpine.js** | No framework build; a recursive `<template>` renders the tree in ~30 lines. (If the inline-hunk DOM juggling outgrows it, preact+htm is the fallback — still buildless) |
| Client bundling | **`bun build`** (built-in), one-shot at publish | End users never build; the package ships prebuilt assets. Solves offline use — no CDN anywhere |
| Theme | **[@catppuccin/palette](https://github.com/catppuccin/palette)** CSS variables | Official palette as CSS custom properties; Latte = light, Mocha = dark; follow `prefers-color-scheme` with a manual toggle persisted in `localStorage` |

```

- Tree: collapsible directories, git status letter + Catppuccin color per file
  (M = yellow, A/U = green, D = red, renamed = teal). A header toggle filters
  the tree to changed/untracked files only (requirement 4).
- Right pane header: file path, git status badge, `[Raw]` toggle for markdown
  source view.

## 4. Server design

`peruse [path] [--port 7440] [--host 127.0.0.1] [--no-open]`.
Binds to localhost only by default. Every request path is resolved and
verified to live under the served root (path-traversal guard). `.git/` is
never listed or served.

### Endpoints

| Endpoint | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /` | The prebuilt static page |
| `GET /api/tree` | Nested JSON tree of the directory (skipping `.git`), each node annotated with git status from one `git status --porcelain=v2 --untracked-files=all` call; also flags gitignored files so the UI can dim or hide them |
| `GET /api/file?path=` | JSON: text content, detected language (by extension), size, binary flag, git status, and `hunks` (below) |
| `GET /raw/<path>` | Raw bytes with correct MIME type — used for images and for relative links/images inside rendered markdown |
| `GET /api/events` | SSE stream of change events |

### Hunk data (requirement 5)

`/api/file` runs `git diff --no-color -U0 -- <path>` (worktree vs `HEAD`, so
staged and unstaged changes both show; untracked files are diffed against
empty via `--no-index`) and parses it **once, server-side** into hunks.
Zero context is deliberate: each hunk is then exactly one contiguous change,
so gutter marks sit only on changed lines and a popup shows only the change
that was clicked — with `-U3`, nearby edits merge into one oversized hunk
(and the popup drags in unchanged neighbors). Context would be redundant
anyway: the popup floats over the file itself.

```json
"hunks": [
  {
    "newStart": 13, "newLines": 2,      // where the bar goes in the current file
    "oldStart": 13, "oldLines": 1,
    "kind": "modified",                  // added | modified | deleted
    "patch": "@@ -13,1 +13,2 @@ def load_sheet\n-...\n+...\n+..."
  }
]
```

`newStart`/`newLines` drive the gutter indicators; `patch` is the exact raw
hunk text, ready to be handed to diff2html client-side with a synthesized file
header. No whole-file diff endpoint exists — the hunk is the unit of diffing
throughout, matching the interaction model.

### Watching → SSE (requirement 6)

One chokidar watcher on the root feeds a broadcast queue consumed by
`/api/events` subscribers, coalesced into ~200ms batches:

```json
{ "changed": ["scripts/gen_efl.py", "README.md"], "git": true }
```

- Changes under `.git/` (index, HEAD, refs) are **not** forwarded as file
  events; they set `"git": true`, meaning "statuses may have moved" (e.g. the
  user committed or staged something in a terminal).
- Client behavior: on any event, re-fetch `/api/tree` (cheap; the tree JSON for
  a normal project is small). If the currently open file is in `changed`, or
  `git` is true and the open file has status, re-fetch it and re-render **while
  preserving scroll position and any expanded hunks that still exist**.
  `EventSource` reconnects automatically; on reconnect the client does one full
  refresh to resync.

This is deliberately dumb — no granular cache invalidation, no tree diffing.
At local-directory scale, re-fetching JSON is faster than being clever.

## 5. Frontend design

### Markdown rendering (requirement 2)

- markdown-it with GFM affordances: tables, strikethrough, autolinks,
  task-list checkboxes, heading anchors, footnotes.
- Fenced code blocks are highlighted with the **same Shiki instance** used for
  code files — so code inside markdown and standalone code files look
  identical.
- A ~10-line markdown-it core rule copies each block token's `map` (source
  line range) onto the rendered element as `data-lines="12-18"` — the standard
  trick from live-preview editors, reused here for change indicators (below).
- Relative links between files are intercepted and opened *inside* peruse
  (tree selection follows); relative image sources are rewritten to `/raw/…`.
  External links open in a new tab.
- Optional (v1.1): Mermaid diagram blocks and KaTeX math, each ~5 lines of
  glue with their standard npm builds. Omitted from v1 to keep the page lean.

### Code rendering (requirement 3)

- Shiki `codeToHtml` with
  `themes: { light: "catppuccin-latte", dark: "catppuccin-mocha" }` —
  dual-theme CSS-variable output, so theme switching never re-highlights.
- Language chosen by extension (Shiki's bundled grammar set covers everything
  in a typical project; unknown extensions fall back to plain text). To keep
  the client bundle sane, a curated grammar subset is bundled eagerly and the
  long tail lazy-loads from the package's own assets.
- Line numbers via CSS counters in the gutter. Large-file guard: above ~1 MB
  or ~10k lines, skip highlighting and show plain text with a notice.
- Binary files: images render via `/raw/`; other binaries show a metadata
  card (name, size, status) instead of content.

### Git change indication (requirements 4 & 5)

Tree level: status letters + colors as in §3; "changed only" filter collapses
the tree to changed/untracked files (directories auto-expanded).

In-file, the *subtle* indicator is the familiar editor gutter mark, driven by
the server's `hunks`:

- **Code files:** a 3px vertical bar in the gutter beside each hunk's
  `newStart..newStart+newLines` — Catppuccin green for added, blue for
  modified (the VS Code / JetBrains gutter colors; the tree's yellow "M" is
  the explorer-badge convention, a different palette) — plus a small red
  triangle marker where lines were deleted.
  Exactly the VS Code / JetBrains gutter convention: legible, ignorable.
- **Rendered markdown:** any block whose `data-lines` range intersects a
  hunk's new-file range gets a 3px accent left-border.

**Click → hunk diff popup.** Clicking a gutter mark (or a marked markdown
block) opens **that hunk only** in a popover anchored at the mark — the
JetBrains gutter-popup convention; the page never navigates away and the
document flow never shifts:

- The popup is absolutely positioned just below the clicked mark, inside
  the scroll container, so it scrolls with the content. One popup is open
  at a time; clicking another mark moves it there.
- The popup body is diff2html rendering *just that hunk*: the client wraps
  the hunk's `patch` in a minimal synthesized diff header. Unified view by
  default; a toggle offers side-by-side. Deleted lines therefore appear
  only inside the popup — the main view always shows the current file.
- Dismissal: click the mark again, the popup's ✕, `Esc`, or anywhere
  outside the popup. A subtle "N changes" chip in the header cycles
  through the changes for review-the-whole-file flow.
- On SSE-driven re-render, an open popup re-attaches to the hunk nearest
  its old `newStart` if one still exists; otherwise it closes silently.

There is deliberately **no whole-page diff mode** — the hunk popup is the
only diff representation, so the reading context is never lost.

### Theming

`@catppuccin/palette` CSS variables define both palettes; a `data-theme`
attribute on `<html>` selects Latte or Mocha (default follows
`prefers-color-scheme`, toggle persisted in `localStorage`). Shiki dual themes
and diff2html variable overrides key off the same attribute, so one attribute
flip restyles everything with zero re-rendering.

## 6. Repository layout & size budget

Standalone repo `talkasab/peruse`:

```
peruse/
  package.json          # name @talkasab/peruse; bin {"peruse": "bin/peruse.js"}
  bin/peruse.js         # CLI arg parsing, open browser        (~40 lines)
  server/index.js       # Bun.serve routes, git, chokidar→SSE  (~280 lines)
  web/
    index.html          # layout + Alpine templates            (~120 lines)
    app.js              # tree/view/hunk/SSE logic             (~350 lines)
    style.css           # Catppuccin variables + layout        (~150 lines)
  dist/                 # prebuilt client (bun build; published to npm)
```

Plain modern ESM JavaScript, no TypeScript compile step (JSDoc types where
they pay for themselves). `bun build` bundles the client libraries into
`dist/` at publish time; a release script runs `bun build --compile` per
target platform to attach standalone binaries to GitHub releases.

## 7. Alternatives considered and rejected

1. **Just run `code serve-web`** — genuinely zero code and covers all six
   requirements, but it's an IDE: heavy process, editing-focused chrome, and
   the reading experience the requirements describe isn't what you get.
2. **Extend markserv or difit** — each would need the *other half* of the
   feature set bolted on (git for markserv, browsing/markdown for difit),
   inside someone else's architecture. More code than the glue server, less
   control.
3. **Python (Starlette + uvicorn + watchfiles), PEP 723 single file** — the
   first draft of this design. Rejected for a standalone tool: all client
   libraries are npm-native (Python could only reach them via CDN at runtime),
   `npx`/`bunx` is the natural distribution channel for this category, and one
   language beats two. watchfiles/Starlette were fine; the ecosystem seam
   was the problem.
4. **Node instead of Bun** — the second draft (Node ≥ 20 + Hono + chokidar +
   esbuild). Node's ubiquity is real, but it costs two extra dependencies
   (Hono, esbuild) that Bun provides built-in, and it has no answer to
   `bun build --compile` standalone binaries — which cover the "I don't have
   Bun" case better than Node ubiquity covers the "I don't have Node" case.
   The code stays plain ESM, so a Node port remains cheap if ever needed.
5. **Server-side rendering (markdown/highlighting on the server)** — fewer
   moving parts in the browser and Shiki runs fine in Bun, but the dual-theme
   CSS trick, scroll-preserving in-place re-renders, and markdown line-map
   plumbing are all simpler with client-side rendering. The server stays a
   dumb file/git/events API.

## 8. Open questions

All resolved (with Tarik, 2026-07-20) — the design defaults stand:

1. ~~**Gitignored files**~~ Resolved: always shown but dimmed, with a toggle
   to hide them entirely.
2. ~~**Diff baseline**~~ Resolved: worktree vs `HEAD` only (staged + unstaged
   together). No staged/unstaged dropdown.
3. ~~**Mermaid/KaTeX in v1?**~~ Resolved: deferred to v1.1; v1 ships lean.
4. ~~**Non-git directories**~~ Resolved: degrade gracefully — no status
   column, no gutter marks, no changed-only filter, no warning. Not an error.
5. ~~**Name**~~ Resolved: `peruse`, repo `talkasab/peruse`, published as
   `@talkasab/peruse` (bare npm name is squatted); installed bin is `peruse`.
